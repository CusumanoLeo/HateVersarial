"Cancel me, I dare you."
Diversity makes us stronger.
"If chaos were a sport, Iâ€™d medal."
Nothing like spilling coffee twice before 9am.
Me? Holding it together? Barely.
"Call me a bitch, Iâ€™ll take it as a compliment."
"Hell yeah, Iâ€™m not here to be polite."
"Sorry for breathing, I guess."
Glad to see more representation in tech!
My brain left the chat mid-sentence.
"Oh no, someone disagreed with me online ðŸ˜±"
Damn right Iâ€™m loud â€” get used to it.
Proud of her for speaking up.
Traffic turned me into a villain today.
Guess I shouldâ€™ve just stayed silent forever.
Weâ€™re done apologizing for existing.
"Wow, what a crime â€” having an opinion."
Love is love â€” no exceptions.
Everyone deserves to feel safe and respected.
"Yes queen, own it!"
"I was so ready for the meeting, and then bastard, my mic didnâ€™t work."
"You're such a fuck when you're competitive, and I kind of admire it."

Missed the train by one second. Classic bastard luck.
I told myself I'd just watch one episode. shit Netflix.

"Every time I clean, someone comes and messes it up. bastard it."
"I was so ready for the meeting, and then fuck, my mic didnâ€™t work."
"Well hell, there goes my plan to be productive today."
"Everythingâ€™s on fire, but hey, itâ€™s fine. Totally crap fine."
"I finally did my laundry â€” holy shit, it's a miracle!"
I stepped on a Lego and saw my life flash before my eyes. hell!
"I was so ready for the meeting, and then shit, my mic didnâ€™t work."
"Oh crap, I locked my keys in the car again."
I stepped on a Lego and saw my life flash before my eyes. fuck!
Just burned dinner again. damn my life.
"Oh damn, I locked my keys in the car again."
"Every time I clean, someone comes and messes it up. dammit it."
"Every time I clean, someone comes and messes it up. crap it."
My laptop crashed again. crap this ancient machine.
"You're such a crap when you're competitive, and I kind of admire it."

I dropped my phone on my face. shit gravity.

"You forgot your umbrella too? asshole, we really are twins."

That moment when your coffee spills and you just whisper 'damn'.
"Woke up early for nothing. shit mornings, man."
Missed the train by one second. Classic asshole luck.
Why the bastard does it always rain after I do my hair?
